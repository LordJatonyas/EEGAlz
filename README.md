# Diagnosis of Alzheimer's with EEG data

An 8-electrode EEG setup to detect Alzheimer's in elderlies.

## What's unique

Current research methodologies use high numbers of electrodes for EEG data collection. Such a device is expensive, and not feasible for routine use.

We want to make things cheaper: focus on a headband design that uses 8 electrodes with similar detection capabilities.
